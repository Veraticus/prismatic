# Prismatic Development Plan

This document outlines the phased development plan for evolving Prismatic from a CLI tool with file-based storage to a modern TUI application with SQLite backend and native Go scanner integrations.

## Current State (January 2025)

Prismatic is currently a **fully functional CLI security scanner** with the following working features:

### âœ… Working Features:
- **Two-phase operation**: `prismatic scan` â†’ `prismatic report`
- **Six security scanners**: Prowler, Trivy, Kubescape, Nuclei, Gitleaks, Checkov (via exec)
- **Database-only storage**: SQLite database with streaming updates (NO MORE JSON FILES!)
- **Beautiful HTML/PDF reports**: Professional "prismatic" themed design
- **Suppression system**: YAML-based suppression configuration
- **Deterministic finding IDs**: SHA256-based for reliable suppression tracking
- **AI enrichment**: Claude-powered enrichment via `prismatic enrich` (database-stored)
- **Real-time scan progress**: Database-backed progress tracking
- **Multi-format reports**: HTML, PDF, YAML remediation, and fix bundles (all database-driven)

### ðŸš§ Development Status:
- **Phase 1**: Database foundation **COMPLETE** and **FULLY INTEGRATED**
- **Phase 2**: TUI transformation **COMPLETE**
- **Phase 3**: Native scanner architecture **COMPLETE** with demo Trivy implementation

## Development Guidelines

1. **Test First**: Write tests before implementation
2. **Small PRs**: One checkbox = one PR when possible
3. **Working Software**: Each phase should produce working software
4. **No Regressions**: Existing functionality must keep working
5. **Documentation**: Update docs with each phase

## Success Metrics

- **Phase Completion**: All checkboxes checked and tests passing
- **Performance**: Each scanner faster than exec() version
- **User Experience**: TUI navigation intuitive and responsive
- **Code Quality**: 80%+ test coverage, all linters passing
- **Database Efficiency**: <100ms query time for common operations
