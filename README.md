## üìã Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Git
- Docker (for container scanning)
- kubectl (for Kubernetes scanning)
- AWS CLI configured (for AWS scanning)

### Installing Security Tools

Prismatic requires the actual security scanning tools to be installed on your system:

```bash
# Check which scanners are installed and get installation instructions
./scripts/install-scanners.sh
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Check which scanners are already installed
- üìã Provide specific installation commands for missing tools
- üîß Verify additional requirements (Docker, kubectl, AWS CLI)

**Manual Installation:**

If you prefer to install specific tools manually:

| Tool | Installation |
|------|-------------|
| **Prowler** | `pip install prowler` or `pipx install prowler` |
| **Trivy** | `brew install aquasecurity/trivy/trivy` (macOS) |
| **Kubescape** | `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubescape/kubescape/master/install.sh \| /bin/bash` |
| **Nuclei** | `go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest` |
| **Gitleaks** | `brew install gitleaks` (macOS) or download from [releases](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/releases) |
| **Checkov** | `pip install checkov` or `brew install checkov` |

**Note:** You only need to install the scanners you plan to use. For example, if you're only scanning AWS, you just need Prowler.

    url: "https://admin.example.com"

# Git Repositories
repositories:
  - name: backend
    path: "https://github.com/mycompany/backend"
    branch: main
  - name: frontend
    path: "https://github.com/mycompany/frontend"
    branch: main
  - name: infrastructure
    path: "https://github.com/mycompany/infrastructure"
    branch: main

prismatic scan -c mycompany.yaml

# Run specific scanners only
prismatic scan -c mycompany.yaml --only prowler,trivy

# Run with increased verbosity
prismatic scan -c mycompany.yaml -v

# Run with custom timeout (in seconds)
prismatic scan -c mycompany.yaml --timeout 3600
```

### 3. Generate Reports

```bash
# Generate HTML report from the latest scan
prismatic report -c mycompany.yaml

# Generate PDF report
prismatic report -c mycompany.yaml --format pdf

# List available scans
prismatic list -c mycompany.yaml

# Generate report from specific scan
prismatic report -c mycompany.yaml --scan-id 2025-01-15-103045
```

## üîç Repository Scanning

Prismatic automatically clones and scans Git repositories for secrets (using Gitleaks) and Infrastructure-as-Code issues (using Checkov). This feature supports both remote Git URLs and local paths.

### Remote Repository Scanning

When you configure remote repositories, Prismatic will:
1. Clone each repository to a temporary directory
2. Check out the specified branch
3. Run Gitleaks and Checkov on the code
4. Clean up the cloned repositories after scanning

```yaml
repositories:
  - name: backend-api
    path: "https://github.com/mycompany/backend"
    branch: main
  - name: frontend-app
    path: "https://github.com/mycompany/frontend"  
    branch: develop
  - name: terraform-configs
    path: "git@github.com:mycompany/infrastructure.git"
    branch: production
```

### Local Repository Scanning

You can also scan repositories that are already cloned locally:

```yaml
repositories:
  - name: backend-api
    path: "/home/developer/projects/backend"
    branch: main  # Will check out this branch
  - name: frontend-app
    path: "./frontend"  # Relative paths are supported
    branch: develop
  - name: current-repo
    path: "."  # Scan the current directory
    branch: main
```

### Private Repository Access

For private repositories, ensure your Git credentials are configured:

```bash
# SSH authentication (recommended)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# HTTPS with credentials
git config --global credential.helper store

# For GitHub, use personal access tokens
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

### Repository Scan Results

Repository findings include:
- **Repository context**: Each finding shows which repository it came from
- **File location**: Exact file and line number
- **Secret detection**: API keys, passwords, tokens (Gitleaks)
- **IaC misconfigurations**: Security issues in Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes manifests (Checkov)

Example finding:
```
üî¥ CRITICAL: Exposed AWS Access Key
Repository: backend-api:src/config/aws.js
Line: 42
Description: AWS access key found in source code
Remediation: Remove the key from code and rotate it immediately
```

### Advanced Repository Options

```yaml
# Coming soon: Additional repository options
repositories:
  - name: monorepo
    path: "https://github.com/mycompany/monorepo"
    branch: main
    # Future features:
    # subpath: "services/api"  # Scan only specific directory
    # shallow: false           # Full clone vs shallow clone
    # exclude: ["test/", "vendor/"]  # Exclude paths from scanning
```

## üìä Report Features

Prismatic generates professional reports featuring:

### Executive Summary
- Total findings by severity
- Scanner coverage status
- Top security risks
- Suppressed findings count

### Detailed Findings
Each finding includes:
- **Severity Badge**: Color-coded with gemstone theme
- **Resource Identification**: What was affected
- **Description**: Clear explanation of the issue
- **Impact Assessment**: Business and technical impact
- **Remediation Steps**: How to fix the issue
- **Business Context**: Owner, data classification, compliance impact
- **Audit Trail**: Original severity, modifications, comments

### Visual Design
Reports use a "prismatic" light-refraction theme with:
- üî¥ **Critical**: Ruby red (#9b111e)
- üü† **High**: Amber orange (#ff6700)
- üü° **Medium**: Topaz yellow (#ffd700)
- üîµ **Low**: Sapphire blue (#4169e1)
- ‚ö™ **Info**: Pearl gray (#708090)

## üõ°Ô∏è Finding Management

### Suppressions

Suppress false positives or accepted risks:

```yaml
# In your config file
suppressions:
  # Suppress specific finding types by scanner
  prowler:
    - "s3_bucket_public_read_access"  # Public website bucket
    - "cloudfront_tls_version"         # Legacy app compatibility
  
  trivy:
    - "CVE-2023-12345"  # False positive in test code
  
  # Global suppressions
  global:
    date_before: "2024-01-01"  # Ignore old findings
```

### Severity Overrides

Adjust severities based on your risk context:

```yaml
severity_overrides:
  # Reduce severity for dev environment
  "s3_bucket_versioning_disabled": "low"      # Was: medium
  "ec2_instance_public_ip": "medium"          # Was: high
  
  # Increase severity for critical resources  
  "rds_backup_disabled": "critical"           # Was: high
  "iam_user_no_mfa": "high"                  # Was: medium
```

### Business Context Enrichment

Add metadata for better prioritization:

```yaml
metadata_enrichment:
  resources:
    # S3 bucket with customer data
    "arn:aws:s3:::customer-uploads":
      owner: "data-team"
      data_classification: "confidential"
      business_impact: "Customer PII storage"
      compliance_impact: ["GDPR", "CCPA"]
    
    # Production database
    "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:db:prod-db":
      owner: "platform-team"
      data_classification: "restricted"
      business_impact: "Primary customer database"
      compliance_impact: ["PCI-DSS", "SOC2", "HIPAA"]
    
    # Public website
    "https://www.example.com":
      owner: "marketing-team"
      data_classification: "public"
      business_impact: "Company website"
```

### Manual Modifications

Make changes to findings after scanning:

```bash
# List all findings
prismatic modifications list -c mycompany.yaml

# Suppress a finding
prismatic modifications suppress <finding-id> \
  -c mycompany.yaml \
  --reason "False positive - test environment only" \
  --expires "2025-12-31"

# Change severity
prismatic modifications severity <finding-id> low \
  -c mycompany.yaml \
  --reason "Mitigated by compensating controls"

# Add a comment
prismatic modifications comment <finding-id> \
  -c mycompany.yaml \
  --comment "Scheduled for remediation in Q2 2025"

# Apply all modifications and regenerate report
prismatic modifications apply -c mycompany.yaml
```

### Adding a New Scanner

1. Create scanner implementation in `internal/scanner/yourscanner.go`
2. Implement the `Scanner` interface:
   ```go
   type Scanner interface {
       Name() string
       Scan(ctx context.Context) (*models.ScanResult, error)
       ParseResults(raw []byte) ([]models.Finding, error)
   }
   ```
3. Embed the `BaseScanner` for common functionality:
   ```go
   type YourScanner struct {
       *BaseScanner
       // scanner-specific fields
   }
   ```
4. Use the `SimpleScan` method if your scanner follows common patterns:
   ```go
   func (s *YourScanner) Scan(ctx context.Context) (*models.ScanResult, error) {
       return s.BaseScanner.SimpleScan(ctx, SimpleScanOptions{
           ScannerName:     s.Name(),
           GetVersion:      s.getVersion,
           Iterator:        NewSimpleTargetIterator(s.targets, nil),
           ScanTarget:      s.scanSingleTarget,
           ParseOutput:     s.ParseResults,
           ContinueOnError: true,
       })
   }
   ```
5. Add to factory in `internal/scanner/factory.go`
6. Update configuration structures
7. Add comprehensive tests following Go idioms
8. Update documentation
